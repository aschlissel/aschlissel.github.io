America Votes (very soon)!  
  
I've always had a strong interest in government and politics (I majored in political science!). Ever since I can remember, I have followed every election closely, down to the local level. So every four years when the presidential election rolls around, I'm glued to the news like

This time it's a little different. The only thing constant about the 2016 presidential election is that every day is a surprise. With each must-read story released and curveball thrown, I'm starting to feel more and more like this:

Which begs the question:  
### DOES THE HORSERACE EVEN MATTER?  
In other words, is the presidential election as candidate-centric and campaign-centric as it seems? What if none of that matters at all?  

My goal was to predict how a county voted in the 2008 election purely based on that county's demographics. I used census data because that was the most far-removed data from politics I could think of. I also chose to exclude how a county voted in the previous general election. Although that data would have improved my model's accuracy, in keeping with the spirit of my project, I thought it was best to use data independent of politics. I used the 2008 election because that was the most recent non-incumbent election, for incumbency tends to influence voters (usually in favor of the incumbent).
